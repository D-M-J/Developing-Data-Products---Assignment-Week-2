Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet
Submit by Sep 23, 8:59 AM CEST
Important Information
It is especially important to submit this assignment before the deadline, Sep 23, 8:59 AM CEST, because it must be graded by others. If you submit late, there may not be enough classmates around to review your work. This makes it difficult - and in some cases, impossible - to produce a grade. Submit on time to avoid these risks.

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

Review criterialess 
The rubric contains the following two questions:

Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?
Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?
